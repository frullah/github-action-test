# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      working_directory: $GITHUB_WORKSPACE

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2.1.3
        with:
          # A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore
          path: Gemfile
          # An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache
          key: -gemfile-{{ env.working_directory }}-${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}
      - run: echo {{ env.working_directory }}
